This is [nibbler](https://github.com/kirkegaard/nibbler.py), but for Slack.

To Do
-----

- Move plugins to async await
- Separate sanic stuff from `bot.py`
- Contexts should probably also make more sense
- Support `.env` file
- Make plugins aware of teams


Notes
-----

Cobe cant run on anything newer than python 3.6.8 :(
